# Student Performance Analytics

## Assignment

There are two CSV files that represent student response data for the years **2021** and **2022**. The columns of the CSV files are:

- **student_id**: Unique identifier for each student.  
- **question_id**: Unique identifier for each question.  
- **ability**: The ability skill of the student.  
- **difficulty**: The difficulty of the question.  
- **answered_correctly**: Whether the student answered the question correctly or not.  

### Questions to Analyze:

1. **How did the student's ability to answer the questions change?**  
2. **Did the questions get more difficult or easier over time?**  
3. **Can you create a model that can predict if a student will answer a question correctly?**  
4. **Note any other observations you may have about the data.**
